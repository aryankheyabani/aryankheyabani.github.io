                        I am a versatile and motivated engineer with a strong foundation in both numerical modeling and
                        software development
                        for engineering applications. My work focuses on advanced simulation techniques and
                        computational mechanics, where I
                        apply and implement high-fidelity numerical methods to tackle complex, real-world problems.

                        Equally, I bring solid experience in designing, developing, and integrating simulation tools
                        using Python, MATLAB,
                        C++, and FORTRAN. I thrive in environments that require fast learning and adaptability, and I
                        have consistently delivered

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            I joined Ansys in November 2024 as an intern in the Ansys Customer Excellence (ACE)
                            department.
                            During my internship, I was engaged in a range of tasks related to advanced fatigue analysis
                            using Ansys products.
                            My responsibilities included preparing technical documentation, tutorials, and workshop
                            materials, as well as building
                            simulation models to demonstrate product capabilities to both current and prospective Ansys
                            customers.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In addition to application-focused tasks, I contributed to the development of Python and
                            IronPython scripts aimed
                            at workflow automation, software customization, and feature enhancement. A key achievement
                            during this period was the
                            development of an Ansys Customization Toolkit (ACT) extension. This extension was designed
                            to automatically generate
                            the input file required for fatigue analysis based on the geometry defined in Ansys
                            Mechanical. I was responsible for
                            designing the extension, implementing the backend code, and integrating it seamlessly into
                            the Mechanical user interface.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            I began my Ph.D. at Sabancı University in 2020 by joining the Computational Mechanics &
                            Engineering Optimization (CMEO)
                            research group led by Associate Professor Dr. Adnan Kefal. During the PhD, I developed a
                            novel computational framework (PHFGMC-IGA-RZT)
                            that integrates high-fidelity microscale modeling with advanced macroscopic analysis
                            techniques. My research combined
                            the Parametric High Fidelity Generalized Method of Cells (PHFGMC), Refined Zigzag Theory
                            (RZT), and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA)
                            to enable accurate simulation of damage progression in layered and sandwich composite
                            materials with complex geometries.
                            The core innovation lies in formulating a multiscale modeling technique that effectively
                            bridges microscale physics with
                            structural-level behavior, resulting in simulations that are both efficient and precise.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            This work led to several first-author journal publications and fostered valuable research
                            collaborations. Building on this foundation,
                            I later enhanced the framework with a higher-order RZT formulation and incorporated
                            Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) for macro-level
                            progressive damage modeling, marking a significant advancement that has been rigorously
                            validated through numerical and experimental
                            studies.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Throughout my Ph.D., I consistently demonstrated research independence by setting clear
                            objectives, breaking down complex projects into
                            actionable tasks, and advancing beyond established methodologies. A semester at TU Darmstadt
                            further strengthened my autonomy, where I
                            integrated into a new research environment under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Dominik
                            Schillinger.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Alongside my research, I actively contributed to teaching and mentoring. I served as a
                            teaching assistant for undergraduate courses in mechanics
                            and computational modeling and supported junior students in their research and programming
                            projects. I am passionate about making technical
                            concepts accessible and engaging, and my clear, structured explanations have been met with
                            consistently positive feedback.

                            Materials - Researcher</div>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            I began my PhD journey by joining this project as a researcher. The objective of the project
                            was to perform experimental and
                            numerical investigations on 3D woven composite materials, focusing on their structural
                            performance. My primary responsibilities
                            included conducting advanced simulations and numerical modeling, and comparing the
                            computational outcomes with experimental data
                            for validation.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Alongside my core project duties, I independently developed a multiscale simulation
                            technique that integrates the Parametric
                            High-Fidelity Generalized Method of Cells (PHFGMC) at the microscale with Refined Zigzag
                            Theory (RZT) defined within an Isogeometric
                            Analysis (IGA) framework. This approach, referred to as PHFGMC-IGA-RZT, was first applied to
                            analyze thick composite laminates and
                            sandwich structures in the linear elastic regime. The results were validated and published
                            in a peer-reviewed journal. I later extended
                            this method to study and compare the mechanical behavior of unidirectional vs. 3D woven
                            sandwich composites, which also resulted in a journal
                            publication.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            To improve the modeling capabilities, I formulated a higher-order RZT model within the IGA
                            framework. Both numerical simulations and
                            experimental tests were conducted to assess the accuracy of the linear and higher-order
                            multiscale techniques, and the validated results
                            were disseminated in several journal papers. The following figure shows the algorithm along
                            with the experimental setup
                            and stress-strain curves demonstrating the proposed formulations’ superiority.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            From a software perspective, I conducted simulations using ANSYS and ABAQUS, gaining
                            hands-on experience in nonlinear and linear analysis
                            of composite and metallic materials. Additionally, I developed an in-house MATLAB code that
                            implements the PHFGMC, RZT, and IGA frameworks.
                            These implementations were later integrated into a unified codebase capable of performing
                            complete multiscale analysis of composite laminates.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In this project, I was responsible for overseeing the experimental phase, including the
                            manufacturing, mechanical testing,
                            and reporting of composite specimens. I also conducted numerical simulations to verify and
                            evaluate the experimental results.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Beyond the core project tasks, I enhanced the previously developed PHFGMC-IGA-RZT multiscale
                            analysis technique to enable progressive damage
                            modeling of composite laminates, sandwich structures, and stiffened plates. This included
                            extending the method to capture nonlinear
                            behavior and failure mechanisms across different material systems and structural
                            configurations.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            These developments marked a key milestone in my PhD research, which aimed to establish a
                            comprehensive multiscale framework for simulating
                            the damage and failure of advanced composite materials. As part of this effort, I also
                            addressed challenges related to mesh dependency in
                            failure analysis, improving the reliability of simulation results under various loading
                            conditions. The outcomes of these studies are published
                            in journal papers and my Ph.D. thesis. Figure 2 presents representative results of the

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            To conduct theoretical studies, I developed and implemented numerical models using ANSYS
                            Workbench and Mechanical APDL.
                            Additionally, I extended the in-house MATLAB PHFGMC-IGA-RZT codebase to incorporate
                            nonlinear analysis capabilities within the multiscale
                            modeling framework. To improve computational performance, I applied vectorization techniques
                            in MATLAB and optimized data structures
                            to reduce execution time. As a result of developing this comprehensive codebase, I gained
                            hands-on experience with the full software
                            development lifecycle, including algorithm design,
                            modular implementation, code optimization, debugging, unit testing, and validation against
                            experimental results.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            During my internship at Ansys, my primary objective was to support Application Engineers by
                            preparing technical documentation,
                            tutorials, workshops, and simulation models for customer presentations. These tasks focused
                            mainly on advanced fatigue analysis
                            using the Ansys nCode DesignLife module and its integrated Add-On within Ansys Mechanical.
                            Although these responsibilities were
                            outside the direct scope of my Ph.D. research, I quickly adapted to the role, demonstrating
                            initiative and autonomy by successfully
                            completing assignments with minimal supervision and to the full satisfaction of my mentors.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            As the internship progressed, my role naturally transitioned into development activities due
                            to my rapid handling of initial tasks.
                            In this context, I was involved in automating fatigue analysis workflows by developing
                            custom buttons within Ansys Mechanical.
                            One of my most significant contributions was the design and development of an ACT extension
                            for generating input files for fatigue
                            analysis of welded structures within both Ansys Mechanical and Ansys nCode DesignLife.
                            Initially, I developed the backend logic of
                            the extension and integrated it into Mechanical using a wizard-based interface. Owing to the
                            added functionality, the tool was
                            approved for integration directly into the Mechanical user interface. To facilitate this, I
                            developed a worksheet extension that
                            ensured seamless UI integration while maintaining Ansys Mechanical’s native look and feel.
                            This work involved backend and frontend
                            development using Python, IronPython, XML, HTML, and JavaScript. I also employed Visual
                            Studio Code, Git Extensions, and Team Foundation
                            Server (TFS) for version control, collaboration, and code management.
